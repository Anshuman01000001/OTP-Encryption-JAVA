# OTP-Encryption-JAVA
A simple encryption program using an uncrackable encryption technique!

## Discription 
This is a command line application that generates a random key using the ASCII table (this program only uses ASCII charactrers from 36 - 126 as the rest are functions) which can encode and decode messages.
